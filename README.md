# mongo-full-web-app

## Description:

It’s an app that act like a virtual music store but instead of downloading tracks, for obvious copyright reasons, downloads a .txt file with the titles you choose from track list.
This project wants to be a proof-of-concept about how to use a mongo database in an express app by performing CRUD operations.
Because it’s my first project that use mongo database ,I had many challenges to overcome regarding syntax and took me a while to fully implement the CRUD operations.

## Install and Run:

To run the project on local host needs to be cloned on local machine. After open a terminal and  run **npm install** command and all dependencies from **package.json** file 
will be installed on your local machine and the project can be ran using **npm strat** command in terminal.
To use the project, go to your favourite browser and just enter 127.0.0.1:3000 and the home page will be visible.

## Issues :

On the hosted app that its on Heroku ,alerts does not work for some reason I don’t understand.

## Final Thoughts:

This project its an assessment for my courses  and must be a proof that i know how to design ,build, and maintain an express app with mongo db.
